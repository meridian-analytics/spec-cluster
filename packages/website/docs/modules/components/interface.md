The `Interface` component utilizes Material-UI (MUI) to provide a user interface for adjusting scale values along three axes (x, y, and z). It integrates with the `Configurator` context to manage the scale states.

## Usage
To use the `Interface` component, simply import it and include it in your component tree. You can also pass additional styles via the `sx` prop if needed.

```javascript
import Interface from './path/to/Interface';

<Interface sx={{ customStyle }} />
```
