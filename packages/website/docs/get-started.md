# Get Started

`SpecCluster` is a react package designed for generating cluster visualizations of spectrograms. Visualizing acoustic samples is essential for understanding complex audio data, enabling users to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and analyze relationships between sound samples. With `SpecCluster`, you can simply visualize spectrogram data to easily interpret the information and draw meaningful conclusions.


## Example Projects

This repo contains two example packages to demostrate various features and configurations of SpecCluster.

* `example-spec-visualization`
* `example-shape-visualization`


To run the examples, change to the package's directory, install the dependecies, and run the `start` script.

```sh
> bun install
> cd packages/example-spec-visualization
> bun start
```

The example webserver will display the connection URL. In the default case, [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
